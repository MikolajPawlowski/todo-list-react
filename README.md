## Description

This basic list management application was made as an exercise in [YouCode](https://youcode.pl) course.<br>
<br>
By **writing in** action to do in the input field, you **add it to the list**.
<br>
<br>
You can then **check it** by pressing green button, or **delete it** by pressing red one.
<br>
<br>
With either one of two appearing buttons you can **show/hide** finished tasks or **mark them all** as finished.
<br>
<br>
You can also **filter**, or **download** example tasks by using redux-saga.
